6502 8-bit CPU Architecture:

8-bit data bus (i.e., it can transfer data 8 bits at a time)
64 KB of addressable memory (16-bit address bus)
56 instructions, including operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, bit manipulation, and logic operations
Registers:
Two 8-bit accumulators (A and B)
Two 8-bit index registers (X and Y)
One 8-bit stack pointers (SP)
One 16-bit program counter (PC)
